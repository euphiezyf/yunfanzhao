                        <h2>Design Question</h2>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">How can we <b>encourage</b> the consumers to <b>engage more in the
                                makeup recycle program</b> to reduce makeup plastic waste in department stores and on
                            official websites?</p>

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p class="content-paragraph compact">Every year, <b>120 billion units</b> of packaging are
                            produced by the cosmetics industry globally and most of them end up in landfills and
                            oceans[1]. According to our survey result, the recycle rate of empty or expired makeup
                            containers is about <b>13%</b>. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph compact">Our main goal is to enhance the beauty product consumers’
                            recycling behavior for reducing the plastic waste. Our prototype is a mobile app,
                            integrating with new physical packaging, that allows beauty product shoppers to participate
                            in the recycle program for recycling empty plastic containers. </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph compact">We hope to form a partnership with the waste management
                            companies such as TerraCycle, department stores, and their official online retailers. In
                            this study, we present a low-fidelity digital prototype via Figma and updated information
                            printed on physical packaging. </p>

                        <p style='margin-bottom: 0;' class="compact">For the secondary research, we applied the
                            methodology of looking up online statistics, data on Statista and findings on academic
                            papers and popular media, and checking out makeup brands' official website and content. We
                            had several key insights:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>120 billion units of packaging are produced by the cosmetics industry globally and most

                            <li>Young women mostly apply makeup several times per week.</li>
                            <li>At least 126 million people who have used makeup in the US.</li>
                            <li>50 percent of people don’t even try to recycle their empty containers as it is deemed
                                “inconvenient”.[2]</li>
                            <li>70% consumers want more environmentally friendly products, but they are not willing to
                                compromise on performance, aesthetics or value brands implementing eco-friendly
                                designs.[3]</li>

                        <h3>Field Observation</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;" class='compact'> For field study, we applied the method of deep
                            hang out and pure
                            observation. Our field study mainly focused on the offline shopping experience from makeup
                            consumers in 4 different makeup stores in Bellevue Square. We chose Lush, M·A·C and
                            BareMinerals as the stores that have recycle programs compared with Sephora as the stores
                            that does not have the recycle program. We utilized deep hang out first in Lush, M·A·C and
                            BareMinerals and asked for the permission, then we utilized pure observation in each store
                            for 0.5 to 1 hour.
                        </p>
                        <b>Key Insights:</b>
                        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li>Although recycle programs exist, no one talks or asks about it. </li>
                            <li>No one has returned any plastic containers in the store. </li>
                            <li>Consumers’ attention is fully on the product itself.</li>
                            <li>Eco-friendly signs are not as obvious as other advertisements or promotions. </li>
                            <li>No displayed information about the recycle program in the store nor on the packaging.
                            </li>
                            <li>The interaction between the sales representative and the consumer is mostly based on the
                                product’s functionality. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Takeaways:</b>
                        <p class='compact'>I have learned that observing real user behavior in the real scenario was
                            hard. I needed to pretent as a shopper, while taking notes and observing them secretly.
                            However, I got super surprised about some of the observation results. For example, during
                            our deep hang out, the sales told me that the current recycle program is running pretty
                            well, and they would ship the returned containers which the amount is usually over 1000
                            monthly. In fact, as we observed during the busy hour on weekends, we found no one had
                            recycled in store.</p>
                        <div class='image main' style="margin-top:0;"><img src='/images/makeup/fieldstudy1.png'></div>

                        <h3>Survey</h3>
                        <p class="compact" style='margin-bottom: 0;'>In the survey, we asked respondents about their
                            general recycling behavior and questions related to the currently available brands with
                            recycle program. Some of the questions we included:</p>
                        <li>How do you deal with your expired makeup (or skincare) or empty containers?</li>
                        <li>Are you aware of recycle programs offered by any of the brand listed here?</li>
                        <b>Key Insights:</b>
                        <li>Most of the respondents do not recycle beauty containers. </li>
                        <li>Few respondents know about the current recycle program while using the product. </li>
                        <li>Respondents don't know the exact information/way to participate</li>
                        <li>Respondents concern about the time and effort of taking the containers to offline stores.
                        </li>
                        <li>Most respondents feel important to recycle and show high interest towards participating in
                            makeup recycle program.</li>
                        <b>Takeaways:</b>
                        <p class='compact'>I have learned that survey is a fast way to gather user's thoughts. But it
                            does have some limitations. For example, it cannot be long; the current free surveying tools
                            have few options of directing questions which potentially bring technical issues. In the
                            future, we should create a flowchart for each branch so it is easier to visualize the logic
                            for better structure.</p>

                                Michelle Smith is a 30-year-old Marketing Manager that earns $150K a year. She uses
                                makeup every day. On weekends, she goes to MAC to buy some foundation and lipsticks. She
                                doesn’t care about any recycling program information and just wants to purchase the
                                products and try some new products. Due to the high frequency of makeup purchasing, she
                                has a lot of makeup that she cannot use up. When she wants to throw away her expired
                                makeup, she cannot tell whether her lipsticks are recyclable or not. Also, she doesn’t
                                want to clean the residue in the containers. So she just throws all of them into the
                                trash.

                                Noel Johnson is a 24-year-old graduate student that has no income. She only uses makeup
                                when she goes to big events. She bought one lipstick from MAC 2 years ago. One day, she
                                somehow remembers that MAC has a recycle program, but she doesn’t find any related
                                information while browsing through MAC’s official website. Then, she chooses to go to
                                the MAC store to recycle it. However, when she brings it back to the store, the sales
                                representative tells her that she needs to bring back at least 6 empty containers for a
                                reward. She is disappointed about it since she doesn’t use makeup often. It’s really
                                hard for her to collect 6 empty containers, but she actually really wants the reward and
                                to be eco-friendly.

                                Emma Collins is a 28-year-old actress. She used makeup every day and often has used up
                                makeup containers. When she wants to dispose of the empty bottles, she suddenly thinks
                                of the recycle program that the MAC has. But she currently doesn’t want to go to the
                                store to return and also doesn’t want to keep them occupying the space on the table.
                                Furthermore, the rewards that MAC currently offers have no appeal to her. She decides to
                                throw them in the trash bin, considering how inconvenient it is the existing recycle
                                program, and feels indifferent about the rewards.

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p class='compact'>Data analysis was not easy after collecting a whole bunch of qualitative and
                            quantitative data. This process helped us to build the skill of analyze data in a macro view
                            that considers all of our secondary research, field study, and survey. </p>

                        <p class='compact'>During this process, we had been arguing a lot. Each member had different
                            standard when facing the problem. Thanks to the discussion, all the thoughts were valuable
                            for driving to shape our final idea. </p>

                        <p class="compact">
                            To fulfill our requirements, our team came up the solution of changing the information on the packaging that potentially leads consumers to use our digital recycle program app. Besides, from the qualitative data analysis, instead of undiversified rewards from each brand, we combined all brands together and wanted to provide different kinds of rewards neutral to all genders and ages.

                        <h2>Usability Test</h2>
                        <p class="compact">For our usability test, at least two team members were present during the 5
                            test sessions. One team member was in charge of videotaping/taking notes, while the other
                            member facilitated the session and pretended to be the sales representative. As a
                            facilitator, the member would read the tasks to the participant and answer any questions in
                            regards to the tasks. In the <b>sales representative</b> role, the member would inform the
                            participants about the recycle program during the checkout process. Our team created a Figma
                            low fidelity prototype of the application for the participants to interact with. The
                            physical prototypes, the makeup containers, were printed by 3D printers. Lastly, we modified
                            the makeup labels with <b>a recycle sign and QR code</b> in Illustrator and glued them onto
                            the physical prototypes.

                        </div>
                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p class="compact">From this evaluation, we could figure out how successfully our prototype
                            communicates with the users. We intially thought the QR code would be fairly noticeable on
                            our physical prototypes. However, there were some participants that were attracted to other
                            information instead. This goes to show that our design may not be as intuitive as we
                            thought, and that we should look into revising it if needed. It also show what types of
                            information is important to the participants, so they may be actively seeking those
                            information. </p>
                        <p class="compact">For further iteration, we would change the physical design, adding a piece of
                            outer packaging to the product and clearly indicating the recycle program related
                            information.</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <h3>Diversity</h3>
                        <p class="compact">This 10-week collaboration experience was so different, compared to my previous experience in cognitive science or computer music study. Every team member in my undergrad was having the similar thinking path, so our solutions were not too diverse or unexpected. However, as a team, Janice has business background, so she paid more attention in if it’s actually can work or not in reality, and Bblythe is from landscape architecture, who cared more about systematic logic framework thinking. I, as a musician, usually had creative ideas initiating our arguments. Overall, we have lots of fun in this 10-week design thinking process and learn a lot from each other. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Problem Driven</h3>
                        <p class="compact">Design thinking should be problem driven, which was totally different from the design framework that I truly applied before. I was always thinking of the solution when first facing the problem that I was going to deal with. This bad habit and bias actually narrowed my thinking and ability to accept various ideas. During this project, I deeply felt about how important the problem driven process was and not thinking of the solution until the ideation stage. In this path, I can truly put myself into users' shoes and empathize the real scenarios.</p>
                        <h3>Design Thinking Application</h3>
                        <p class="compact">Within this 10-week "brainwashing" design thinking, the framework has built into my mindset. As for doing another school project and deciding its problem statement and direction, finding second research and backup evidence was extremely helpful to guide our path for digging more in. Thanks to design thinking, I have been changed to ask more questions started with WHY, HOW, and WHAT, instead of only focusing on the solution. </p>
                        <h3>Design Topic Influence</h3>
                        <p class="compact">We have been practicing to recycle correctly since we got this design topic, which we did not really pay attention to before. 

                            Since the design that we made is to help make the world better, and our design process focused on human behavior a lot, the design thinking helped us to expand our vision. According to the reasearch that we have done, a good design not only can make users’ lives easier, it also can reshape designers’ perspectives unintentionally and help us to be better people. </p>
